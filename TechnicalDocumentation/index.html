                    Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

                    It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

                    It is used for:

                    Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
                    Desktop applications
                    Web applications
                    Web servers and application servers
                    Games
                    Database connection
                    And much, much more!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
                    It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
                    It has a large demand in the current job market
                    It is easy to learn and simple to use
                    It is open-source and free
                    It is secure, fast and powerful
                    It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
                    Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
                    reused, lowering development costs
                    As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>
                        public class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                        System.out.println("Hello World");
                        }
                        }
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

                        Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

                        This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

                <p> Follow The Steps : </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Go to "System Properties" (Can be found on Control Panel > System and Security > System >
                        Advanced System Settings)
                    </li>
                    <li>Click on the "Environment variables" button under the "Advanced" tab</li>
                    <li>
                        Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button
                    </li>
                    <li>Click on the "New" button and add the path where Java is installed, followed by \bin. By
                        default, Java is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1 (If nothing else was specified
                        when you installed it). In that case, You will have to add a new path with: C:\Program
                        Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin
                        Then, click "OK", and save the settings</li>
                    <li>
                        At last, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type java -version to see if Java is running on your
                        machine
                    </li>

                <p>
                    JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with
                    the database. It is a specification from Sun Microsystems that provides a standard abstraction(API
                    or Protocol) for Java applications to communicate with various databases. It provides the language
                    with Java database connectivity standards. It is used to write programs required to access
                    databases. JDBC, along with the database driver, can access databases and spreadsheets. The
                    enterprise data stored in a relational database(RDB) can be accessed with the help of JDBC APIs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enterprise applications created using the JAVA EE technology need to interact with databases to
                    store application-specific information. So, interacting with a database requires efficient database
                    connectivity, which can be achieved by using the ODBC(Open database connectivity) driver. This
                    driver is used with JDBC to interact or communicate with various kinds of databases such as Oracle,
                    MS Access, Mysql, and SQL server database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before jumping into JDBC Drivers, let us know more about API.

                    API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is essentially a set of rules and protocols
                    which transfers data between different software applications and allow different software
                    applications to communicate with each other. Through an API one application can request information
                    or perform a function from another application without having direct access to it’s underlying code
                    or the application data.

                This spring tutorial provides in-depth concepts of Spring Framework with simplified examples. It was
                developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. Spring framework makes the easy development of JavaEE application.

                It is helpful for beginners and experienced persons.

            <p>
                MVC is short for Model, View, and Controller. MVC is a popular way of organizing your code. The big idea
                behind MVC is that each section of your code has a purpose, and those purposes are different. Some of
                your code holds the data of your app, some of your code makes your app look nice, and some of your code
                controls how your app functions.

                MVC is a way to organize your code’s core functions into their own, neatly organized boxes. This makes
                thinking about your app, revisiting your app, and sharing your app with others much easier and cleaner.
            </p>
            <p>
                MVC is a way to think about how an web application works.

                It’s kind of like how you make Thanksgiving dinner. You have a fridge full of food, which is like the
                Model. The fridge (Model) contains the raw materials we will use to make dinner.

                You also probably have a recipe or two. A recipe (assuming you follow it exactly) is like the Controller
                of Thanksgiving dinner. Recipes dictate which stuff in the fridge you’ll take out, how you’ll put it
                together, and how long you need to cook it.

                Then, you have table-settings, silverware, etc., which are what your hungry friends and family use to
                eat dinner. Table-top items are like the View. They let your guests interact with your Model and
                Controller’s creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                MVC is helpful when planning your app, because it gives you an outline of how your ideas should be
                organized into actual code.

                For instance, let’s imagine you’re creating a To-do list app. This app will let users create tasks and
                organize them into lists.

                The Model in a todo app might define what a “task” is and that a “list” is a collection of tasks.

                The View code will define what the todos and lists looks like, visually. The tasks could have large
                font, or be a certain color.

                Finally, the Controller could define how a user adds a task or marks another as complete. The Controller
                connects the View’s add button to the Model, so that when you click “add task,” the Model adds a new
                task.

                class Student {
                    private String rollNo;
