            Rajput began his acting career after dropping out of his engineering course at the Delhi College of
            Engineering and entering the theatre industry in Mumbai. He moved on to feature in Hindi television serials,
            his debut show was the romantic drama Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008), followed by the lead role in the
            soap opera Pavitra Rishta (2009–2011). He made his film debut with the film adaptation Kai Po Che! (2013)

            Rajput died by suicide at his home in Bandra, Mumbai, in June 2020, aged 34.[6][7][8] Various controversies
            surrounded his death. The Narcotics Control Bureau claimed Rajput had been using various people to obtain
            drugs since 2018 and filed abetment charges against them. Abetment to suicide charges were filed against his
            former girlfriend, while the Supreme Court refused to quash a case against his sister Priyanka which alleged
            she had supplied him psychotropic anti-depressants without proper medical consultation, using a forged
            prescription. His last film, Dil Bechara (2020), was released posthumously on the streaming platform
            Hotstar.
